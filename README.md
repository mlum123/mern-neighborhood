Neighborhood app built with the MERN stack

Neighborhood is a full-stack web application I built to allow neighbors to help each other out during COVID-19 by posting their needs and/or offers of help.
Neighborhood acts as a digital community bulletin board and encourages neighbors to get to know each other and create a tight-knit community during these difficult times.

## Technologies Used
MongoDB and Express for the backend
React for the frontend
Node.js environment
Redux for state management
JSON Web Tokens for user authentication
Reactstrap to incorporate Bootstrap with React
